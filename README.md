# Fitness Gurukul Website

Multi-page Fitness Gurukul website with a responsive frontend, **Python** backend, and SQLite database.

## Stack

- Frontend: HTML pages at the repo root (`index.html`, `services.html`, …) plus `styles.css` and `app.js`
- Backend: dependency-free Python HTTP API in `server.py` (port **8000**)
- Database: SQLite file created automatically as `fitness_gurukul.sqlite3` (gitignored)
- Two interfaces: user website (`/`) and owner portal (`/backend.html` / `backend.html`) — plus full backend at `/backend`

The old Node/Express server is deprecated. Use Python only.

## Run locally

### Windows (PowerShell)

`python3` often fails on Windows (Microsoft Store stub). Use one of these instead:

```powershell
copy .env.example .env
py server.py
```

or:

```powershell
python server.py
```

or double-click / run:

```powershell
.\start.bat
```

If Windows says **Python was not found** / opens the Store:

1. Install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. During setup, check **Add python.exe to PATH**
3. Open a **new** PowerShell window
4. Optional: Settings → Apps → Advanced app settings → App execution aliases → turn **OFF** `python.exe` and `python3.exe`

### macOS / Linux

```bash
cp .env.example .env
python3 server.py
```

### Any OS via npm (optional)

```bash
npm --prefix tools/local-server start
```

Open the website:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

### Two interfaces

**1) User website** (customers):

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

Public pages only: home, services, coaches, booking forms. No owner tools in the main menu.

**2) Owner portal** (you):

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/backend.html
```

Your private DB dashboard for leads. On your computer it usually unlocks automatically.

Aliases for the owner portal: `/owner`, `/dashboard`  
Full advanced tools: `/backend` (aliases: `/office`, `/admin`, `/staff`)

Local defaults:
- If you copy `.env.example`, password is `fitnessgurukul`
- If no password is set and the server is on localhost, it also defaults to `fitnessgurukul` and auto-unlocks `/backend.html` / `backend.html`

The public footer keeps a small **Owner login** link; it is not in the customer navigation.

By default the server binds to `127.0.0.1`. To share on the same Wi-Fi:

```bash
HOST=0.0.0.0 python3 server.py
```

Then open `http://YOUR-LAPTOP-IP:8000/backend` on another device. Backend APIs still require the staff password.

## Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:

```text
OPENAI_API_KEY=
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-5.6
ADMIN_TOKEN=fitnessgurukul
HOST=127.0.0.1
PORT=8000
```

- Without `OPENAI_API_KEY`, the chat widget answers from local website facts.
- Change `ADMIN_TOKEN` (or `ADMIN_PASSWORD`) before sharing the server beyond your machine.

## Production stack (only these two)

| Role | Host | What lives there |
|------|------|------------------|
| **Frontend** | **Hostinger** | HTML/CSS/JS, `config.js`, `/api/*.php` fallback |
| **API** | **Render** | `server.py` + SQLite leads (`fitness-gurukul-api`) |

Do **not** deploy this repo to Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, Railway, or Fly.io. Those configs were removed so git pushes stop fighting each other.

### Frontend — Hostinger

Upload or git-pull the site root onto Hostinger (public_html / domain root for `fitnessgurukul.app`):

- All `*.html`, `styles.css`, `app.js`, `config.js`, `assets/`, `coaches/`, `api/`
- PHP fallbacks under `/api/*.php` keep forms working if Render is asleep

### API — Render

[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/saikrishnacoder/i-want-you-to-creating-a)

Or: Render → New → Blueprint from this repo (`render.yaml`).

1. Confirm the service URL is `https://fitness-gurukul-api.onrender.com` (or update `config.js` to match)
2. Set a strong `ADMIN_TOKEN` in the Render dashboard
3. Health check: `./scripts/verify-api.sh https://fitness-gurukul-api.onrender.com`
4. Redeploy / re-upload Hostinger so live `config.js` matches

`config.js` already points at Render:

```js
window.FG_API_BASE = "https://fitness-gurukul-api.onrender.com";
```

Lead flow:

- Forms → `POST {FG_API_BASE}/api/submit` → SQLite on Render
- Challenge → `POST {FG_API_BASE}/api/challenge-join`
- Owner portal → `https://yoursite.com/backend.html` (same `ADMIN_TOKEN`)
- If Render is down: Hostinger `/api/*.php`, then WhatsApp prefill

**Notes**

- Free Render apps may sleep after idle; first request can take ~30s.
- SQLite on free tiers is usually ephemeral (resets on redeploy). Export leads from the owner backend regularly, or add a paid disk.

### Disconnect other hosts (one-time, in their dashboards)

Repo-side configs for these are gone. Unlink Git so they stop failing on every push:

1. **Netlify** — Site settings → Build & deploy → stop builds / unlink GitHub for every site tied to this repo (`soft-chimera-8a4214` and any duplicates).
2. **Vercel** — Project → Settings → Git → Disconnect (both `i-want-you-to-creating-a` projects if present).
3. **GitHub Pages** — Settings → Pages → None (workflow already removed).
4. **Railway / Fly** — delete or disconnect any project linked to this repo.

## Pages

- `index.html` — home
- `about.html` — brand story
- `services.html` — plans and services
- `coaches.html` — coach directory
- `events.html` — corporate and community events
- `testimonials.html` — client stories
- `tools.html` — fitness calculators
- `contact.html` / `book-consultation.html` — lead forms
- `dashboard.html` via `/backend.html` / `backend.html` — owner portal (your DB interface)
- `office.html` via `/backend` — full advanced backend tools
- `owner-data.html` — optional protected SQLite viewer

## API endpoints

Public:

- `GET /api/health`
- `GET /api/content` — plans, enriched coaches (images/highlights), testimonials, live snapshot
- `GET /api/live` — rotating studio pulse + DB-backed inquiry/tool counters
- `GET /api/goals` — goal matcher catalog
- `POST /api/match` — interactive goal → plan/coach recommendation
- `GET /api/chat/status`
- `POST /api/chat`
- `POST /api/submit` — consultation and corporate event forms
- `POST /api/leads` — alias that stores into the same submissions/leads tables
- `POST /api/calculations`

The public pages are API-driven: coach grids, home minds carousel, live stats, and the goal matcher hydrate from these endpoints (with local fallbacks if the API is offline).

Protected (header `X-Admin-Token: <ADMIN_TOKEN>`):

- `GET /api/admin-data`
- `GET /api/submissions`
- `GET /api/office-stats`
- `PATCH /api/submissions/:id/status` — `new` | `contacted` | `qualified` | `closed`
- `DELETE /api/submissions/:id`

Backend UI (`/backend` → `office.html`) reads the live SQLite database and lets staff search leads, update status, export CSV, and delete records.

Sensitive paths (`.env`, `*.sqlite3`, `data/`, `server.py`, etc.) are not served as static files.

## Security notes

- Do not commit `.env`, `*.sqlite3`, or `data/*.json`
- Never share `/backend` or `owner-data.html` without the staff password
- Prefer localhost bind unless you intentionally need LAN access
- Change the default local password before exposing the server on Wi‑Fi
